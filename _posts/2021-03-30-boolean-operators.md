## What are Boolean operators?
The most important Boolean operators are NOT, AND and OR. Depending on the code language, they are written in a different manner.



Boole's most important suggestion is that all categorical subject-predicate constructions involve classes of objects that are logically related by a limited number of functions. Boole identifies three logical operators, which have the modified effect of the ordinary language terms, ‘not’, ‘and’, and ‘or’. Also known respectively as complementation, conjunction, and disjunction, these three logical connectives are the Boolean operators, which can be represented more technically but not yet symbolically as NOT, AND, and OR.
Dale Jacquette, in Handbook of the History of Logic, 2008
