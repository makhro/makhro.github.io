# Intro

Markdown is a syntax which is very suitable for publishing on the Internet. Markdown is easy to learn. Its limited range of functions for text formatting is actually a strength of the language: This way the author can fully concentrate on the content rather than on exhaustive coding for formatting and layout. Another big advantage of Markdown is the readability of the raw code, since there is no need for excessive use of brackets and indentations.
In the following the most basic format functions will be presented. With these at hand you will be able to create a tidy and plain markdown document.



# Headings
>\# Heading 1 <br>
>\## Heading 2 <br>
>\### Heading 3 <br>
>\#### Heading 4 <br>
>\##### Heading 5 <br>
>\###### Heading 6 <br>


# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

The number of levels for headings depends on the environment. As for Github, there apparently exist only three levels.  

<br>

# Linebreak

<br> perform a line break with<br>

> \<br>

Alternatively, you can also press enter twice. This would result in a new paragraph.

# List

>\- list item 1<br>
>\- list item 2<br>
>**tab** \- list item 2.1 **Use tab to indent list items.**<br>
>**tab** + **tab**        \- list item 2.1.1

- list item 1
- list item 2
    - list item 2.1 **Use tab to indent list items.**<br>
        - list item 2.1.1

# Text Formatters

> \*italic text\* or \_itaic text\_

*italic text*

> \*\*bold text\*\* or \_\_bold text\_\_

**bold text**

> \~\~crossed text\~\~

~~crossed text~~

> \*\*combined \_formaters\_ \~\~\_test\_\~\~\*\*

**combined _formaters_ ~~_test_~~**<br>

# Hyperlinks

Link test in brackets is followed by the URL in parentheses.

> \[Google it\]\(https://google.com\)

[google.com](https://google.com)

As for the Jekyll theme of this blog, make sure to prepend your url with http(s)

# Code snippets

You can include code snippets in your markdown document. Depending on the environment in which markdown is implemented, you can also specify the language of the code for proper syntax highlighting.

> \```python<br>
> import numpy as np<br>
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
>
> a = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=10000)<br>
> plt.hist(a)<br>
> \```


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=10000)
plt.hist(a)
```

            2.096e+03, 7.160e+02, 1.200e+02, 1.100e+01]),
     array([-4.42778238, -3.598825  , -2.76986762, -1.94091024, -1.11195286,

# Including images

>\<img src="\{\{site.baseurl\}\}/assets/images/tools/ad_tuft_of_cowslips.jpg">

Make sure to specify the path to the image correctly.

Make also sure to check out <a href="https://markdown.de/">markdown.de</a>, a German website which offers a good introduction into writing with Markdown.

As for any other language or software, Google and Stack Exchange hold the answer to almost every question. There is a vast amount of websites, videos and forums dealing with questions that come up when working with Markdown, so you will most likely find a proper solution for your problem.
