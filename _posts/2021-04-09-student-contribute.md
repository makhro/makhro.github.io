In consultation with the chair, students have the opportunity to publish their work done at the chair in the form of a scientific blog post here on makhro.github.io.
This blog aims to inform about the work of the chair, but also about the work of the students and the topics we teach. The author of the post is given the opportunity to present his work and the acquired knowledge and skills.

The following points should be considered when writing a post:
- The length should be appropriate to the format of a blog. Focus on the main content and statements of your work. (It is difficult to determine an exact word count, but it should exceed the length of a social media post, but it should also not be equivalent to an entire term paper).
- As a bachelor student you can write either in German or in English. We recommend that you write your paper in English - regardless of the language of the source text. This is in line with international practice in research, where English has established itself as the [lingua franca](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca).Writing the blog post also provides a good writing exercise.
- Master students have to write in English.
- Blog posts are created using Markdown. A brief overview of the most essential commands can be found in [this post]({% post_url 2021-02-03-markdown %}). In addition to Markdown, HTML commands can also be used.
- More information on issues related to creating posts for Github Pages using Markdown and HTML can be found on the web. If you do not find what you are looking for, you can of course also contact members of the department (e.g. johannes.ossadnik@uni-rostock.de).
- If you use images in your post, please provide them to us as well. When using third party media, please make sure that copyright is respected.
- This post can serve as a template for you to create a post: [Stefan Wilhelm: Welfare, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Labor Supply of Single Mothers]({% post_url 2021-04-08-wilhelm-single-mothers %}).<br>
