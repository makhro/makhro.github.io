Notebooks combining data, code and formatted text grow increasingly popular within the research community. The reasons for this are at hand: These tools offer a great opportunity for streamlining work flows, they make research and analysis more comprehensible and create new ways of collaboration and publishing.

There are a variety of alternatives, which address slightly different needs and audiences.
Alternatives such as Spyder and Apache Zeppelin as well R Notebooks and Matlab Live Editor - to name just a few solutions.
I work with Jupyter, but in the end it is just a matter of taste which software and notebook you use. Well, and of course of the code you are going to employ.

## Why Jupyter?
Jupyter is a free of charge browser based IDE (integrated development environment), designed for a seamless work flow experience for programmers. Its popularity comes in handy when problems arise, since the web holds a vast amount of sites offering answers, help and troubleshooting as well as ideas and inspiration.
The Jupyter system supports more than 100 programming languages, including Python, R, Matlab, Octave, Stata, SAS, Julia... You name it - Jupyter most likely has a kernel for it<sup>1</sup>.
Texts are written using Markdown and Latex formulas are also supported. The freedom you lose in terms of text format and layout is made up for by the simplicity of Markdown and the ability to concentrate on content rather than appearance.

## Drawbacks
Like for everything, there also exist shady sites, yet Jupyter offers a good starting point for programming and data analysis.
To name at least one drawback: Some kernels are slower than the original program and tend to be quite unstable. One example is stata_kernel, which often freezes when working with big .dta files or when running more complex commands.

## Installation
Jupyter requires Python 3.
Further instructions on installation can be found here: [https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

## Jupyter at our Chair
I use Jupyter for my research as well as for teaching.
However, this does not mean that I expect students to work with Jupyter, too.
We just try to teach you a little bit more than Macroeconomics, since it is not (only) theory that you will need in your later career.
Working with and analyzing data, software and coding, presentation and visualization of results: All these skills you can train and improve working with Jupyter - or a similar IDE.

## Example
If you want a preview of what it feels like to work with Jupyter notebooks, you can follow this link to have a look at a multi-language demo at mybinder.org (which is a great service for hosting your notebooks and rendering them interactive): <br>

<sup>1</sup> Kernels require a installation of the reference software.
