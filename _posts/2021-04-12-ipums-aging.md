## Demographics, economics and health outcomes of aging and life course
The **LIFE COURSE CENTER** of the University of Minnesota (U.S.) recently initiated the *Network for Data-Intensive Research on Aging* in collaboration with **IPUMS**. The project manages and maintains the world's largest data collections on population.<br>
The data features information on approximately 3 billion persons from 2,000 censuses an surveys, covering 100 countries. <br>
The data should facilitate and deepen understanding of the life course and health outcome of aging, as well as of the demography and economics of this process.<br><br>
Since demographic research is strongly represented in Rostock by the Institute of Sociology and Demography at the University of Rostock and by the  Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, this program seems like made for interdisciplinary research and/or collaboration at the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences. <br>
The registration is  free. However, data is only available after applying for access. You should have a proper research topic at hand.
