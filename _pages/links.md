## Study

- <a href="https://quantecon.org/"><b>QuantEcon.org</b></a> <br>
Founded by Thomas J. Sargent (New York Unicersity) and John Stachurski (Australian
  National University), the site aims to provide free teaching of quantitative economics.
  It offers lecture series on economics, finance, and econometrics. The special feature:
  Only open source languages are used and free access to code and libraries is granted to whomever is interested.

  The site provides both a good introduction to programming with open source languages suitable for economics and to the theory of quantitative economics.
