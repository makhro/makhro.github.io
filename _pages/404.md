# 404

Oops, seems like there isn't a page at this URL. You can try again by going back to the [homepage]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}).

## But why 404?

The story goes that in the 1980s, in the very first hours of the www, scientists at CERN (Switzerland) sent file requests to colleagues in room 404. Two to three people processed the requests and forwarded the requested files to the person who had requested them. If a requested file could not be found, the requesters received a standard message with the content "Room 404: File not found."
